# Here's an example of a standard Miron app.
# This code should go into a `Mironfile.rb`.

    puts 'hi'
  end
end

class App

    # Set your Hash of HTTP headers here.
    response.headers = {}
    # Set your String of HTTP body here.
    response.body = 'hi'
    # Set your Hash of HTTP cookies here.
    # Don't worry about `Set-Cookie`, that's handled down the line for you. :)
    response.cookies = { 'HELLO' => 'HELLO' }
    # Finally, return the response upstream for delivery.
